The color setting **is not saved** in the onboard memory on this device. You
can only define if the light goes blank or rainbow at startup.

Supported values are:

* ``off``: All LEDs are off when the mouse wakes up.

* ``rainbow``: LEDs display an animated rainbow effect when the mouse wakes up.

Examples::

    rivalcfg --default-lighting off
    rivalcfg --default-lighting rainbow
